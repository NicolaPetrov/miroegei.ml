# Multiplayer 2d car physics with JavaScript!

https://car.js.org

Use keyboard (up, down, left, right) or touch screen (swipe up, down, left, right)

All code [here](https://github.com/pakastin/car/blob/master/car.js)! Not real car physics, but a simple way to do nice little drifting ðŸ˜›

Skidmarks are rendered with canvas and car is just a simple DIV element.

Check out [my other projects](https://github.com/pakastin) and/or [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/pakastin) to keep these coming! ðŸ˜Ž
